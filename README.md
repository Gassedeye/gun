# gun
This repository is to host firearms related project.

My interest is to create comprehensive knowledge of firearms for gun designer.
And publish it for all the people who can gain some benefit from this.
Plan is to create tree diagram of topics
To make it possible, I'm gonna discuss about various techniques to classify firearms.

For now, my goal is to establish knowledge, classify firearms, and hopefully create community around it.
